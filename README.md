# malpreprocessor
An exercise in creating a preprocessor for a fictional language called MAL (micro assembly language). Written in C++

This is an exercize I did for one of my classes. I chose to work in C++ to get more experience in it. Normally I use Atlassian's git framework
(bitbucket and sourcetree) and then port information over to github in my someportfolio repository. But I figured someone may like to actually
see a commit and branch history to confirm that I know how to set up a version control workflow, so that's why I initiated this repo right
on my github account. 

Concepts demonstrated include OO design, encapsulation, enumerations, various data structures, blocking i/o, bitwise logic, and lexical 
analysis--if you look in my commit history you'll discover that I was initially using regular expressions
for string matching, but it was required for the assignment that I not use regular expressions, so they were removed.
